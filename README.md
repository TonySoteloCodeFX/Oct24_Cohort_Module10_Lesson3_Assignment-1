# JavaScript Arrays and Strings

## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental operations on JavaScript arrays and strings. It covers essential array manipulation methods like adding, removing, sorting, and applying array functions. Additionally, it explores common string manipulation techniques such as length retrieval, case conversion, substring extraction, and splitting.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the JavaScript file.
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file that contains all the array and string operations, logged to the console.

## Features
### 1. Array Manipulation
- Adding and removing elements using `push()` and `pop()`.
- Sorting an array using `sort()`.
- Applying array methods:
  - `map()`: Doubles each number in an array.
  - `filter()`: Filters even numbers from an array.
  - `reduce()`: Sums up all elements in an array.

### 2. String Manipulation
- Retrieving string length using `length` property.
- Converting cases using `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`.
- Extracting substrings using `substring()`.
- Splitting a string into an array using `split()`.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Open the browser console (Right-click > Inspect > Console) to view the logs.
